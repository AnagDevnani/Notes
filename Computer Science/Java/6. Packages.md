- Packages are containers for classes.
- They are used to keep the class name space compartmentalized.
	- //Similiar to the header files in cpp.
 - For e.g. a package allows you to create a class named list which can be stored in a package...<font color=red>missing</font>
- Syntax:
	- ```java
	  package package_name;
	  ```
- Java uses file system directories to store packages.
	- for e.g. .class files for any classes of a package must be stored in the subsequent package folder.
- Syntax for importing:
	- ```java
	  import pkg1.pkg2.class;
	  import pkg.*; //import all in a package
	  ```
