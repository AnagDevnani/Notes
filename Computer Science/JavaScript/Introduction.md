# Extras:
- JAMStack stands for JavaScript, API, Markup and was coined by Mathias Biilmann.
- The default port number used by a flask application is 5000.
- SPA stands for Single Page App in the context of an app.
- PWA stands for Progressive Web App in the context of an app.

# Origins

- Originally created in 1995 as a scripting language to be used for Netscape Navigator (which was a popular web browser at the time.)
- Intended to be a "glue" language:
	- Stick modules from other languages together
	- Not really meant for much code.
- Primarily used to assist "applets" in Java - hence the name JavaScript.
	- Therefore Java & JavaScript don't have much in common apart from the name.
	- The name JavaScript actually lead to many trademark issues and name changes but JavaScript just stuck.
- As the language was intended to be a glue language with limited coding functionality of its own it is quite slow and has limited capability.

Around 2005 it was discovered that JavaScript could be used for so much more especially demonstrated in Google Maps, Google Suggest etc.
	- JavaScript provided a fluid user interface that would allow to pan around the map, zoom in/out seamlessly.
	- This was achieved by loading only what is needed.

This process was described and named as AJaX by James Garrett which stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

JavaScript therefore, allowed true "web applications" that behave like desktop applications.

# Standardization
Due to the increasing popularity of JavaScript, a need had been developed to move beyond Netscape and standardize the language so as to not be bound by a particular browser or company.

Therefore, the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) developed standard 262, subsequently called ECMAScript (thereby avoiding trademark issues with Java).
