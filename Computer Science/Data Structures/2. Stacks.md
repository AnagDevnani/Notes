# Introduction
- Non - Primitive, Linear Data Structure.
- Last in first out, First in last out.
- Push, Pop for insertion and deletion respectively.
- If an element is attempted to be added to a stack, it is called stack overflow. (Top > Limit)
- If an element is made to be deleted from an empty stack, it is called stack underflow (Top $\leq$ -1)

## Algorithms for Push(), Pop()  and Display()
```c
void push(){
	if (top == max-1){
		printf("Stack overflow");
		return
	}
	else{
		top++;
		s[top]=item;
		return;
	}
}

int pop(){
	if (top == -1){
		printf("Stack Overflow");
		return 0; //not sure if possible to return something that can't be in the stack
	}
	else{
		top--;
		return item;
	}
}

void display(){
	i=top;
	while (i!=-1){
		printf("%d", s[i]);
		i--
	}
	return;
}
```
