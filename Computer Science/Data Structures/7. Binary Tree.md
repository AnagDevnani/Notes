# Introduction
- Tree: It is a non-primitive non-linear data structure used to represent some relationship b/w the elements.
- Binary Tree: includes set of nodes with:
	- One specially designated node as root.
	- Each node in the tree can have atmost 2 nodes.
- Degree of a node: Max no. of children that a node can have <font color=red>(not sure if correct)</font>
- Level: Tree is organized at level, where root is at level 0.
- Leaf: A node with no successor or children (pendant node)
- Ancestor: A node N1 is said to be an ancestor of node N2, if N1 is either father of N2 or father of some ancestor of N2
- Edge: Line b/w 2 nodes.
- Path: Sequence of edges b/w 2 nodes.
- Degree / Height: Max level at which leaf node is present in a binary tree.
- Siblings: nodes from the same parent node.

## Types of Binary Trees
### Strictly Binary Tree
Every non leaf node must strictly have 2 children.

### Almost complete Binary Tree
Any node at level n-1 has two children and each node at level n from left to right have two children.

### Complete Binary Tree:
Complete binary tree is where all nodes are at the same level
i.e. $2^n$ nodes at the $n^\text{th}$ level


## Properties
1) Max 2^i^ nodes at the i^th^ level
2) Max no. of nodes in a binary tree with height $h$ is: $2^h-1$
3) $n=E+1$ (n = nodes, E = edges)
4) no. of binary trees that can be formed from n nodes:
$$
\frac{1}{(n+1)}\ ^{2n}C_n
$$
5) In a binary tree with n nodes, minimum possible height = $\log_2(n+1)$

## Creation of binary search tree
```c
//first val is root
//subsequent values are compared with the following nodes starting from root and we move:
	//left if value is smaller than node
	//right if values is greater than node

create_bst(){
	node *new1, *ptr, *curr;
	while(1){
		new1=(node *) malloc(sizeof(node));
		pf("Enter data: ");
//incomplete <-------fill code here--------->
	}
}
```

## Tree Traversal
### Pre
1. Root
2. Left in Pre
3. Right in Pre

### In
1. Left in In
2. Root
3. Right in In

### Post
1. Left in Post
2. Right in Post
3. Root

# Code to create a Binary Tree
```c
struct Tree{
	struct Tree *left;
	char info;
	struct Tree *right;
};
typedef struct Tree tree;
tree *root = NULL, *temp;
void main(){
	root = (tree *)malloc(sizeof(tree));
	create(root);
	display(root);
}
void create(tree* ptr){
	tree *newleft, *newright;
	char ch;
	if (ptr!=NULL){
		printf("Enter Element:");
		scanf("%c",&ptr->info);
		printf("Do you want to add left child of %c (Y/n)");
		ch = getchar();
		if (ch == 'y' || ch == 'Y'){
			newleft = (tree*) malloc(sizeof(tree));
			ptr->left=newleft;
			create(newleft);
		}
		else{
			ptr->left=NULL;
		}
		printf("Do you want to add right child of %c (Y/n)");
		ch = getchar();
		if (ch == 'y' || ch == 'Y'){
			newright=(tree*) malloc(sizeof(tree));
			ptr->right=newright;
			create(newright);
		}
		else{
			ptr->right=NULL;
			create(NULL); //NO IDEA WHY THIS IS HERE
		}
	}
}
void display (tree *temp, int level){
	if (temp != NULL){
		display(temp->right,level+1);
		for(i=0;i<level;i++){
			print(" ");
		}
		print("%c", temp->info);
		display(temp->left,level+1);
	}
}
void search(tree *temp, char item){
	if (temp==NULL){
		if (item==temp->item){
			flag = 1;
			return;
		}
		search(temp->left, item);
		search(temp->right, item);
	}
}
