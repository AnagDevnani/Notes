Strings

# Introduction
- Null terminated character array
```c
char str[size]
```
 - <font color=red>check if true.</font> The compiler automatically adds '\0' to all the empty spaces in the string.
 - The name of the string is a pointer to the beginning of the string.
 - The size of the string should be equal to maxinum number of characters in the string plus one. <font color=red> check what means (i think it might be so that there is at least 1 '\0' at the end of the string.)</font>
 - The other way to initialize a string:
```c
char str[] = {'H','i', '\0'};
```
- We can also declare a string with a size much larger than the number of elements that are initialized.
```c
char str[5]='Hi';
```
Will give a string such that :
|H|i|\0|\0|\0|
|---|---|---|---|---|

- Consider the following declaration:
```c
char str[3];
str="Hello"; //Error
```

## Reading Strings
- Strings can read from the user using 3 ways:
	- `scanf("%s", str)`
	- `gets(str)`
	- using `getchar()`, `getch()` or `getche()` function repeatedly:
```c
i=0;
ch=getchar(); //Get a character
while(ch!='\n'){
	str[i]=ch;
	i++;
	ch=getchar();
}
str[i]='\0'; //terminate str with null character
```

In this method, it is mandatory to append with a null character.

## Writing Strings
- Strings can be displayed on the screen in 3 ways:
	- `printf("%s", str)`
	- `puts(str)`
	- using putchar() function repeatedly:
```c
i=0;
while(str[i]!='\0'){
	putchar(str[i]);
	i++;
}
```

## <font color=red>String Slicing</font>
check how to do that `printf("%num1.num2s", str)` things.

# Operations on Strings
- Finding length
	- while
- Convert to Uppercase
	- str[i]-=32
- Convert to Lowercase
	- str[i]+=32
- Concatenating
- Comparing strings

## Concatenation
```c
char str1[len1], str2[len2], str3[len1+len2-1]; //len1+len2-1 because len1 and len2 are both 1 more than the maximum chars, so their sum will be 2 more than the maximum chars
int i=0,j=0;
while (str1[i]!='\0'){
	str3[j]=str1[i];
	i++;
	j++;
}
i=0;
while (str2[i]!='\0'){
	str3[j]=str2[i];
	i++;
	j++;
}
str3[j]='\0'; //adding null char at the end
```

## Comparing two strings
We will break this program into 2 parts:

One where both the strings are of the same length and thus. "comparable".

The other case where they are of different length length and are thus not equal (or greater / less than) since they are not comparable.

In the case of equal length, we traverse through each list comparing characters until they are unequal and using their ASCII values to decide greater than / less than.
```c
char str1[len1], str2[len2];
int i=0, comparable=0, equal=1;
if (len1==len2){
	comparable=1;
}
if (comparable=1){
	while(str1[i]!='\0'){
		if(str1[i]!=str2[i]){
			equal=0;
			break;
		}
		i++;
	}
}
else{
	printf("Not Equal, Not Comparable")
}
if equal=1{
	printf{"Equal"}
}
else{
	if (str1[i]>str2[i]){
		printf("String 1 greater")
	}
	else{
		printf("String 2 greater")
	}
}
```
