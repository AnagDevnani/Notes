Q. What does the term "communication" imply?
Q. Why is effective communication vital in today's world?

# Introduction (What is communication)
"An effective relationship always starts with effective communication. It is the lifeline of any relationship."
\- Kanye West

Communication is the actionable transfer of information from one person, group, or place to another by writing, speaking, or using a medium that provides a means of understanding. Every communication consists of a minimum of one sender, a receiver, and a message.

Effective Communication can be thought of as the bridge between communication and clarity. Effective communication is one of the cornerstones of modern society. Good communication is what enables us to socialize, share and express our thoughts.

The primary distinguishing factor between Humans an Wild Animals is the fact that we are able to communicate so effectively and efficiently. It is due to the fact that we are able to share our thoughts, ideas and feeling with other fellow humans that we were able to come together and form a vast society

Matter of fact, India's independence is the epitome of effective communication. It was only due to the fact that our Freedom Fighters such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore to name a few who were able to convey the idea of a free and liberal India which led us to Independence.

Therefore I close with the words of Nelson Mandela that "Communication is merely the exchange of information. Effective Communication is understanding the thought, feelings and emotions behind that Information"
