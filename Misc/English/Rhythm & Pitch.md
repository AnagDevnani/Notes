# Rhythm
- Another name of reppeated patterrn of sounds, an arrangement of syllables in a unit of speech.
- In art forms, each line contains nearly equal no. of syllables

## Stress in Words
Example:
```
I thought you sister was a bus conductor
```
As we change the stress of the word from 'I' to 'condductor'. the implied meaning of the sentence drastically changes.

# Pitch
- Important component of accentuation or prominenceboth at the level of individual words and longer utterances.
- Piitch is determined by the frequency with which the vocal chords vibrate.
- Pitches are compaerd as "higher" or "lower".
- Variety of pitches should be used to hold the listener's attention.
- Raising the pitch toward the end of the sentence should be avoided.
- The rise & fall of the voice conveys emotions
	- Example: saying "Thank You" changes emotion based on pitch as:
		- Low $\longrightarrow$ Sad
		- High $\longrightarrow$ Happy
		- Balanced $\longrightarrow$ Neutral

Therefore:
- Pitch, loudness & tempo continue to make up a language's expression of rhytym.
- Languages vary greatly in the way in which they make rhythmical contrasts.
