# What is "Integrity"? 
Oxford Dictionary defines "integrity" as the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles or as the state of being whole and undivided. An integral person is responsible, truthful and trustworthy.
Integrity, therefore is a virtue which is very much expected from professionals since they are trusted by the company and the people. This Implies that the behavior of a person is unaffected by whether he is surrounded by people or alone, whether he is watched or let free. However this is not always the case amongst professionals. Certain professionals act without integrity in discharging their duties & responsibilities.

# Lack of Integrity amongst professionals
A lack of integrity in an individual implies that a person is dishonest and in a way, immoral. They can be termed as being irresponsible, untruthful and untrustworthy. 

A few examples and scenarios where this may be observed are:

## 1) Forgery of data
- Forgery refers to fabrication of data which does not exist.(i.e reporting data from experiments which were never conducted.)
- Imaginative and Incorrect data like this can severely hurt data-oriented fields like Statistics, R&D and Analytics

## 2) Plagiarism
- Plagiarism refers to the act of thieving or stealing of others ideas or reports and passing it off as your own
- This can have far reaching consequences which may hurt the original creator in the long run and may ruin the credibility of the original work.
- Plagiarism covers unethical cheating in examinations and tests.
- Plagiarism also covers the incorrect and unintended use of Intellectual Property such as illegally distributing, copying or modifying said property
- This is prevalent in multiple forms of media such as Music, Novels, Journalism, Reporting, Movies, Poems, Games, Software Technology etc.

## 3) Trimming
- Trimming refers to smoothing or incorrectly adjusting / rounding off data to make it seem accurate and precise.
- it is mostly present in the Scientific, Analytic and R&D Sectors and can lead to incorrect observations and results.

## 4) Withholding Information
- It is the act of using only those information or results which may be favorable or may fit a certain structure or theory and discrediting and discarding of the remaining information.
- This is common in many legal cases where witnesses may or may not provide the full information which leads to misunderstanding.

## 5) Dishonest Accreditation
- Many a times, especially in a group one or more members may be given credits and cited as contributor to the work without actually putting any contribution or effort into it.
- Other times a person may not be mentioned / credited for putting in work to a project which leads to a deserving individual not getting praise or accreditation that they deserve.

## 6) Carelessness and Irresponsibility
- Failure to account for precautions and procedures which could be prevented.
- Ideally, a professional would put in so much work and care into a product or project that it addresses each and every complaint that the people may have. This is referred to as a pro-consumer approach.
- Revealing classified or secretive information of a company is one such example. This should be looked after especially in client-professional relationships.
- Nowadays, in modern times with the onset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this is more prevalent than ever. As OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.0 which is widely used by professionals is used to generate results or do some work for them which provides results that are often incorrect, incomplete, plagiarized 

## 7) Conflicts of Interest
- Many times it is observed that a person may perform actions against the interest of the company under the influence of some temptation, monetary or materialistic (gifts etc.) in order to gain some benefit for themselves.
- A few examples would be bribes to witnesses, law officials etc.

# Conclusion
From the given examples and scenarios, it is clear that lack of integrity amongst professionals harm not only their reputation but also the companies that they represent and the people that they may deal with.
It causes the company to lose its reliability which may have been built over a long period of time. This can cause enough damage both materially and mentally to the clients and can be deal-breaking for them as well causing major losses to all those who were involved.

Lack of integrity also has many ethical repercussions which have affected a huge variety of people over the decades. Both undeserved oppurtunities and punishments are a direct result of this.
