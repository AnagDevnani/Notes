## To Draw Inclined lines at multiples of $15\degree$ using only T-Square and Set-Squares
- We use the $30\degree-60\degree$ and/or $45\degree-45\degree$ Set-square.

# 4) Dimensioning
- Only those dimensions which are required for production, inspection and functioning of an object must be mentioned.
	- Those dimesions which were required in the making of the drawing should not be mentioned.

## List of important elements:
### Dimension Figure
- Numerical Value that is written on the line.
### Leader Line
- Continous Thin Line: Type B
- Drawn from a dimension figure to the object which it specifies.
- These are drawn at $30\degree$, $45\degree$ or $60\degree$ to the horizontal.
- The tail end should be the base of the dimension figure 
### Projector Line / Extension Line
- Continous Thin Line: Type B
- Terminated Gapless
- Drawn Perpendicular / Obliquely to the outline.
### Dimension Line
- Continous Thin Line: Type B
- Terminated Gapless
- Terminated by Arrowheads or Oblique Lines (At $45\degree$)
- Drawn parrallel to the line to be measured.
- Generally to be placed **outside** the views.
### Construction Line
- Continous Thin Line: Type B
- Extended slightly beyond point of intersection.

## Arrowheads:
- Barbs can form an angle of $15\degree$ to $90\degree$
- $\text{Length} : \text{Width} = 3:1$
- Can be Open, Closed or Closed AND Filled.

## Units of Dimensions
- Dimensions should be in 1 unit as much as possible.
- Recommended unit is $\text{mm}$.
- When using only 1 unit, the unit is ommited from the dimension figure and mentioned as a footnote "ALL DIMENSIONS IN $\text{unit}$" written at a prominent place.

## System of Dimensioning
#### 1) Aligned System
- Dimension Figures are drawn Parallel to the lines without breaking
- Drawn in such a way that is both parallel and readable from the bottom. (Inclined and facing the bottom of page)

#### 2) Unidirectional System.
- Dimension Figures are drawn breaking the line in the middle facing the right side up.
- Drawn Such that it is **NOT** inclined and facing upright.

## Shape Identification Dimensioning
|Symbol|Meaning|
|:----:|:-----:|
|$R$|Radius|
|$SR$|Spherical Features (Radius)|
|⌀|Circular Features|
|$\square$|Cross-Section|
|$S$⌀|Spherical Features (Diameter)|

# 5) Freehand Sketching
- Uses HB Grade Pencil with Soft Eraser

### For Straight Lines:
- Loose Grip and 30-40mm from tip of pencil

### Circles:
- Draw a square with side length = Diameter of the circle
- Mark Midpoints of the sides and draw Diagonals of the Square
- Mark Points for diameter of the circle of the circle on the diagonals
- Draw arcs tangential to the midpoints passing through the diagonals.

### Ellipse:
- Draw Major and Minor Axes
- Complete Rectangle using Major & Minor Axes as Midpoint Lines
- Draw the Initial Curve only part of the ellipse at the ends of the major & minor axes
- Complete the Ellipse by joining the initial curves.

 # Projection of Solids
- A 3-D Object is bounded by surfaces which may be plane or curved (or both)
 - Solids are classified as:
	 - Polyhedron
	 - Solids of Revolution
 - **Regular Polyhedron:** Solids bound by plane surfaces formed by regular polygons.
 - **Prisms:** Polyhedron formed by 2 equal, parallel regular polygons with end faces connected by side face which are usually rectangular but may be other shapes as well.
 - **Pyramids:** A polyhedron formed by a plane surface as its base and a number of triangle as its side faces, all meeting at its apex.
 - **Axis:** Imaginary Line connecting the apex and centre of the base.
 - **Solids of Revolution:** When a line known as generator that is parallel or inclined to the axis is revolved about the axis, it turns into a solid of revolution
 	- **e.g.** Cylinder, Cone, Sphere.
