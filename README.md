ALOT of the material present here is NOT mine and is sources from various sources. I have tried my best to provide credit wherever I could, but due to the scope of the project, it simply isn't possible to cover everything. Please keep that in mind.

Also it is very likely that there are errors present or there are topics missing, so please fact check anything that's important and please do not rely on this as your only source of information. Proceed with caution.

This repository mainly exists to serve as a reference for me to know which topics I have covered and which I haven't.
