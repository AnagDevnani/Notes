# Some Important Definitions 
- **Sample Space $(\Omega$ or $S)$:** Set of all basic outcomes
- **Event $(\text{E})$:** Subset of Sample Space.
	- We say an Event has occured if the outcume is contained in the sample space upon applying some condition.
	- Set Operators $(\cup,\ \cap, \ X')$ and Subsets can be applied to Events.
		- If for two events $E$ and $F$, If $E \ \cap \ F=\phi$ then, the events are **mutually exclusive** or **disjoint**
		- For complement the universal set is S.
		- If all outcomes of $E$ are in $F$, we say $E$ is a subset of $F$ and is **contained in** $F$.

# Main Interpretations of Probability
## 1) Classical Approach (Apriori / Theoretical):
- $S$ is the sample space of a random experiment having $n$ equally likely outcomes.
	- And an Event $E$ consists of $m$ of these outcomes
	- Then, we say that $\mathbb{P}(\text E)=\frac mn$

## 2) Relative Frequency Approach (Aposteriori or Empirical):
- We repeat the experiment (infinitely) many times and record our observations
- If $n(E) is the number of times, an Event E occurs in the repetition of experiment:
	-	$\mathbb P(E)=\lim\limits_{n\ \rightarrow\ \infty} \frac{n(E)}{n}$

## Subjective Approach
- "Best Guess" method
	- Basically Almost Complete guesswork
- The probability of an event measures the individuals belief in that event
- e.g. predicting whether someone would win the election even if they are standing for the first time.

# Condtitional Probability
- Relevant when an Event has already occured
