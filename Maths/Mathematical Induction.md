# Principle of Mathematical induction
Let $P(n)$ be a statement with $n \in \N$ then:
$P(n)$ is true for all natural numbers if:
- $P(1)$ is true
- $P(k+1)$ is true whenever $P(k)$ is true.

**Note:** If it is to be checked if $f(n)$ is divisible by some no. $p$ then: 
- check that $f(1)$ is divisble by $p$
- divide $f(k+1)$ by $f(k)$ and check if the remainder is divisible by $p$

# Second Principle of Mathematical Induction [Extended Principle]
1. Verify that P(n) is true for $i$ and $i+1$ both
2. Secondly, check for divisibitly for 9 with rule of coefficients and add some additional characters which should help with proing theroems.
