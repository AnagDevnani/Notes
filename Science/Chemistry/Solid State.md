- Less Intermolecular Spaces
- Particles are fixed and vibrate about their mean positions
- Almost Incompressible (rigid)
- Do not diffuse at all.

| **Examples:** All Metals, Salts, Sugar, P<sub>4</sub>, S<sub>8</sub>, Iodine, Diamond, Graphite, Fullerenes, Quartz, etc. | **Examples:** All Polymers, Glass, Plastic, Rubber, Talc, Lampblack, Charcoal, Wood, Cellophane, Fiber Glass, etc. |

**Anisotropy:** Ability to **change** the values of Physical Properties (Conductance, Refractive Index etc.) with change in direction.

**Isotropy:** Ability to keep the vale of Physical Property almost the **same** with change in direction

**Polycrystalline Solids:** Solids which appear Amorphous but have **Micro-Crystalline** Structures. These Individual Crystals are randomly oriented which cause it to appear isotropic despite being crystalline.
**E.g.** Metals show Isotropy due to this

# Packing Fraction

$$
\frac{\text{Volume occupied by atoms}}{\text{Volume of unit cell}} = \frac{Z.{\Large\frac{4}{3}}\pi r^3}{a^3} 





$$

| Unit Cell | Square \[2-D\] | Hexagonal \[2-D\] | Simple Cubic | Body Centred | Face Centred | Hexagonal \[3-D\] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Packing Efficiency** | 78.5% | 90.75% | 52.4% | 68% | 74% | 74% |

# Density of Unit Cell

$$
\frac{\text{Mass of unit cell}}{\text{Volume of unit cell}} = \frac{Z.m}{a^3} =\frac{Z.M}{a^3.N_A}
$$

**Note:** No. of Unit Cells = $\frac{\text{Mass of crystal}}{\text{Mass of Unit Cell}}$

# Structure of Ionic Solids

- For an ionic solid to be efficiently packed it is required that a particular ion is surrounded by as many opp. ions as possible.
- As cations are generally smaller in size, they occupy void positions in a crystal (exception: CaF<sub>2</sub>)

## Radius Ratio Rule

$\frac{\text{radius of smaller ion}}{\text{radius of larger ion}} =\frac{r^+}{r^-}$ (generally)
**Note:** when r<sup>+</sup> \> r<sup>-</sup>, location of cation & anion are exchanged

| Radius Ratio | Type of Void | Coordination No. | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **$0.155 \leq\frac{r^+}{r^-}<0.225$** | Planar Triangular | 3   | Boron Oxides |
| **$0.225 \leq\frac{r^+}{r^-}<0.414$** | Tetrahedral | 4   | Zns |
| **$0.414 \leq\frac{r^+}{r^-}<0.732$** | Octahedral | 6   | NaCl, NaBr |
| **$0.732 \leq\frac{r^+}{r^-}<1.00$** | Cubic | 8   | CsCl |

**Note:** Anions generally do not touch each other however, in limiting or critical case, they touch each other.

# Imperfections in Solids

- Defects are irregularities / imperfections in the arrangement of constituent particles in a crystalline solid.
- Defects are generally formed when crystallization occurs at a fast or moderate rate.
- No crystal is free from defects, even single crystals formed when crystallization occurs at a very slow rate have defects.

```

# Stoichiometric Defect

- Also called **Intrinsic** defects or **Thermodynamic** defects

## 1) Vacancy Defect

- When some of the lattice sites are vacant and the atoms/ions are missing from their original places.
- This can develop when the crystal is heated

<img src="../../_resources/50b92dfe1aa15985226a185ed7eda498.png" alt="50b92dfe1aa15985226a185ed7eda498.png" width="150" height="150" class="jop-noMdConv">

### Schottky Defect

- In Ionic Solids, this is known as Schottky Defect
- In Schottky defect, equal no. of anions & cations are missing to maintain electrical neutrality.
- Schottky defect is usually shown by those solids where anion & cation have similiar sizes. It is also shown in those solids with high Coordination No.
    **e.g.** NaCl, KCl, CsCl, AgBr
    **Note:** Density of the crystal decreases in both Vacancy as well as Schottky defect. However, in Schottky Defect, electrical Conductivity increases

## 2) Interstitial Defect

- When some of the constituent particle occupy interstitial sites in the crystal, and extra atoms/ions are present in between.

<img src="../../_resources/a2d6720b7f0d53cde82732a0a288e8aa.png" alt="a2d6720b7f0d53cde82732a0a288e8aa.png" width="150" height="135" class="jop-noMdConv">

### Frenkel Defect

- In Ionic Solids, this defect is known as Frenkel Defect or Dislocation Defect.
- In Frenkel Defect, the smaller ion is dislocated from its normal site to an interstitial site, Therefore creating a Vacancy defect at its original location and an Interstitial defect at its new location.
    **e.g.** AgCl, AgBr, AgI, ZnS
    **Note:** In Interstitial Defect, the density of the crystal increases, however in Frenkel defect, the density of the crystal remains the same whereas its electrical conductivity increases

**Note:** AgBr shows both Frenkel & Schottky Defect

# Non-Stoichiometric Defect

## 1) Metal Excess Defect

### a) Due to anionic vacancies \[F-centre Defect\]

<img src="../../_resources/ee0476414cdfb1548affc964eadedc23.png" alt="ee0476414cdfb1548affc964eadedc23.png" width="150" height="162" class="jop-noMdConv">

- Usually shown by Alkali Metal Halides
- In this defect unpaired electrons occupy the anionic sites creating an excess of metal
- This defect occurs when Alkali Metal Halides are heated in the presence of corresponding alkali metal vapor. The halide ions diffuse to the surface and combine with the vapours to give alkali halides at the surface.
- The released electrons from the alkali metal diffuse into the crystal and occupy anionic sites.
- The anionic sites occupied by unpaired electrons are called F-centres (from German word - Farbenzenter meaning color centre)
- Due to the presence of electrons, they may get excited by absorbing energy and impart a color onto the crystal

**e.g.**

$$
\underset{\text{(White)}}{\text{NaCl}} \xrightarrow[\text{Na Vapours}]{\Delta}\underset{\text{(Yellow)}}{\text{NaCl}}
\\
\
\\
\underset{\text{(White)}}{\text{LiCl}} \xrightarrow[\text{Li Vapours}]{\Delta}\underset{\text{(Pink)}}{\text{LiCl}}
\\
\
\\
\underset{\text{(White)}}{\text{KCl}} \xrightarrow[\text{K Vapours}]{\Delta}\underset{\text{(Violet / Lilac)}}{\text{KCl}}
$$

### b) due to presence of extra cations:

- In this defect, the anion is lost upon heating due to which an excess of metal is created
- the metal ions move to interstitial sites and the electron to neighbouring insterstitial sites

**e.g.**
$$
\underset{\text{(White)}}{\text{ZnO}} \xrightarrow{\Delta}\text{Zn}^{2+}+\text{O}^{2-}\longrightarrow\underset{\text{(Yellow)}}{\text{Zn}_{1+x}\text{O}}+\frac12\text{O}_2+2e^-
$$

## 2) Metal Deficiency Defect

- This defect occurs due to absece of cations from lattice site or extra interstitial anions
    **e.g.** $\ce{FeO -> Fe_{0.93}O}$
- Here, some Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions are replaced by Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions

# Impurity Defect

## 1) Substitution Impurity Defect

**e.g.** Brass $(\ce{Cu + Zn})$

## 2) Interstital Impurity Defect

**e.g.** Steel $(\ce{Fe + C + Ni + Cr\text{...}})$

**Note:** In Ionic Solids, Impurity defect occurs such that the charges are balanced.
**e.g.** If NaCl is doped with SrCl<sub>2</sub> the Sr<sup>2+</sup> ion occupies Na<sup>+</sup> ion's position and to maintain electrical neutrality, 1 **additional** Na<sup>+</sup> ion leaves its postion.

# Electric Properties

<img src="../../_resources/75623ccb68f011b3e1a85927cd332795.png" alt="75623ccb68f011b3e1a85927cd332795.png" width="300" height="212" class="jop-noMdConv">

- Semi-Conductors' Conductivity can be increased by rise in tempertaure due to which more electrons can jump to the conduction band.

## 1) n-type Semiconductors

- When Element of Group-14 is doped with Group-15 Element they form 4 covalent bonds and the 5<sup>th</sup> electron becomes unbounded and delocalised.

## 2) p-type Semiconductors

- When Element of Group-14 is doped with Group-13 Element they form 3 covalent bonds and form an electron hole or electron vacancy.

## Applications of n-type & p-type Semiconductors

- A Diode is a combinaion of n-type & p-type Semiconductors and is used as a rectifier.
- Transitors are made by sandwhiching a layer of Semiconductors \[npn & pnp\] and are used to detect and amplify Radio or Audio Signals
- Solar Cell is an efficienct photo-diode used for conversion of light energy into electrical energy.
- Combinations of G-13 and G-15 elements form Semiconductors in the form of compounds such as GaAs, InSb, AlP.
    - GaAs conductors have a very fast response time.
- Combinations of G-12 and G-16 elements form Semiconductors in the form of compounds such as ZnS, CdS, CdSe, HgTe
- These compounds are not covalent andd ionic character depends upon the electronegatvities of the 2 elements.
- Transition elements' Oxides also show marked differences in electrical properties:
    - TiO, CrO<sub>2</sub> & ReO<sub>3</sub> behave like metals
    - ReO<sub>3</sub> is like Copper in its Conductivity and Appearance
    - Oxides like VO, VO<sub>2</sub>, VO<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>3</sub>, show metallic or insulating properties depending upon temperature.

# Magnetic Properties

- Every Substance has some Magnetic Properties associated with it which depend upon its electrons as each electron behaves like a tiny magnet.

Its Magnetic Moment is due to 2 types of motion of electron:

1.  Its orbital motion around the nuclues
2.  It spin motion around its own axis.

<img src="../../_resources/c08806cdaef0ee59058d44e601728514.png" alt="c08806cdaef0ee59058d44e601728514.png" width="290" height="130">

- Electron being a charged particle undergoing these motions can be considred to be a small loop of current which posses a magnetic moment.
    - Thus each electron has a permanent spin and orbital motion attached to it.
- Magnitude of this magnetic moment is very small and is measured in Bohr Magneton $(\mu_B)$.
    $\mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \text{Am}^2$

**For Ferromagnetic, Anti-Ferromagnetic & Ferrimagnetic Substances:**

- In Solid State, ions are grouped together in small regions called **Domains** which acts like a tiny magnet.

**Note:** Upon heating Ferrimagnetic substances they lose their magnetism and become paramagnetic
**Note:** In solid state, the ions are grouped together into small regions called domains and each domain act slike a tiny magnet.
**Note:** Initially, Domains in Ferromagnetic substances are randomly oriented and their magnetic moments get cancelled.
