# Introduction
- Chemical Kinetics is the study of the speed of a reaction.

$$
\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}
$$

- The rate of consumption/prodcution is found by the slope: $\frac{d[R]}{dt}$ and is then divided by its stoichiometric coeffecient to find the rate of the reaction. <font color=red> WHY????</font>
- Therefore rate of the reaction, $r$:
$$
r = -\frac1a\frac{d[A]}{dt}=-\frac1b\frac{d[B]}{dt} = \frac1c\frac{d[C]}{dt}=\frac1d\frac{d[D]}{dt}
$$
## Graphs
1) Concentration vs Time Graph
- It gives:
	- Speed of reaction at time, $t$ (Instantaneos Speed)
	- Average Speed of Reaction at a given time interval (Average Speed)
	- Amount of Substance consumed/produced by area under ther graph (Integration)
