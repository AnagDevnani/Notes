# Simultaneous Reactions
## a) Series Reactions
$$ 
\ce{\underset{{c - x}}{A} <=>[k_1]\underset{y + x}{\ce{B}}+\underset{x}{\ce{C}}}
$$
$$ 
\ce{\underset{{y}}{B} <=>[k_2]\underset{y}{\ce{D}}+\underset{y}{\ce{E}}}
$$

$\therefore \text{k}_1 = \Large\frac{x.(x+y)}{c-x}$

$\therefore \text{k}_2 = \Large\frac{y^2}{x-y}$

## b) Parallel Reaction
$$ 
\ce{\underset{{c_1 - x}}{A} <=>[k_1]\underset{x+y}{\ce{B}}+\underset{x}{\ce{C}}}
$$
$$ 
\ce{\underset{{c_2 - y}}{D} <=>[k_2]\underset{x+y}{\ce{B}}+\underset{y}{\ce{E}}}
$$

$\therefore \text{k}_1 = \Large\frac{x.(x+y)}{c_1-x}$

$\therefore \text{k}_1 = \Large\frac{y.(x+y)}{c_2-x}$

# Degree of Dissociation
$$
\alpha = \frac{\text{amount dissociated}}{\text{amount taken initially}}
$$ 

# Acid-Base Theories
## 1) Arrhenius Concept:
$$
\text{Acid}\implies \ce{H+ Donor}\\
\text{Base}\implies\ce{OH- Donor}
$$
- Wasn't always true and was required to be replaced.

## 2) Lewis Concept:
$$
\text{Acid}\implies \text{L.P. Acceptor}\\
\text{Base}\implies\text{L.P. Donor}
$$
- As some molecule do not have active $\ce{H+ or OH-}$ groups to lose but generate it in their Aqueous solution.

## Lux-Flood Concept:
$$
\text{Acid}\implies \ce{O^{2-} Acceptor }\\
\text{Base}\implies\ce{O^{2-} Donor}
$$
- Some Acids generate Protonic acids or Hydroxyl groups in aqueous solution.
- Only applicable in the Molten state
