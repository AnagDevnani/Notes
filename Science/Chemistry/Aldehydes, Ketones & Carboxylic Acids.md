# Pinacole-Pinacolone Rearangement

**Pinacole:** Vicinal Diols
**Pinacolone:** Rearranged vic- Diols, can be either Aldehydes or Ketones.

1.  H+ attaks over -OH
2.  H2O gets removes and Carbocation is formed
    \[H+ Attacks where Carbocation is Stable -> Major Product\]
3.  Shifting of Group \[ -H > -Ph > -R\] for rearraangement of Carbocation
    \[More e- donating -> More shifting ability\]
4.  Formation of double bond \[Back-Bond\] between C+ and -OH group
5.  Removal of H+ from -OH

**Note:** It is called Rearrangement as the H+ is regenerated and H2O is eliminated as a by-product.

# Acid Anhydrides

COOH-HC--CH-COOH has 2 geometrical Isomers

Cis- Malic Acid
Trans - Fumeric Acid

- Malic acid has greater dipole moment than fumeric acid
- Fumeric acid will have greater bp. than Malic Acid
    \[Intermolecular vs Intramolecular H-Bonding\]
- Formation of Malic Anhydride \[Malate\] is possible however, Formation of Fumic anhydride is not possible due to planarity

# Claisen-Schidt Condensation
- Occurs between Aldehyde / Ketone with $\ce{\alpha-{H}}$ and Aromaic Carbonyl compound **lacking** $\ce{\alpha-{H}}$
- It is a specific variation of Aldol Condensation (Cross-Aldol)
