- **Nanoparticles:** Particles of the order of 1-100 nm in atleast one dimension.
- Richard Feynam said that "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" long before the term nanotechnology was used.
- Term "nanotechnology" first coined by Norio Taniguchi in 1974.

# 1) Properties:

- These properties are often not present in the bulk material.

## 1.1) Catalytic Activity / Surface Area

<img src="../../_resources/0d7a0b62f2dac0e7e3cf5072a73213c6.png" width="84" class="jop-noMdConv"> <img src="../../_resources/8ab0755b1b0d3e1a5b58536cad39835b.png" width="200" class="jop-noMdConv">

- Surface Area increases due to increase in number of particles for same volume.
    - $\therefore$ High Surface-to-Volume ratio.
- Therefore, Nanoparticles show catalytic property as increased surface area $\rightarrow$ more active sites.
    - **e.g.** Bulk Gold is practically inert, however Au-NP is used as a catalyst for low temperature oxidation of CO and Partial Oxidation of Hydrocarbons.
- Porous materials exhibit high surface area:
    - If pore size is < 2 nm, they are called Micropores
    - Mesopores have size 2 – 50 nm
    - Macropores have size > 50 nm

## 1.2) Optical Properties

- Nanoparticles show a wide range of colors depending upon the particle size.
- This occurs due to **Surface Plasmon Resonance Phenomenon (SPR)**
    - If the size of nanoparticles is smaller than the wavelength of light, <span style="color: red;">It causes coherent oscillation matches of conduction band electrons induced by the interaction with an electromagnetic field</span> between electronic states
    - This causes absorption and emission of light of specific wavelength which gives specific colors.
- **e.g.** for Gold:

| Particle Size | Color |
| :---: | :---: |
| $2-5 \text{ nm}$ | Yellow |
| $10-20 \text{ nm}$ | Red |
| $> 20 \text{ nm}$ | Purple |

## 1.3) Magnetic Properties

- Increase in magnetic coercivity and paramagnetic behavior
- Magnetic nanoparticles show remarkable new phenomena such as superparamagnetic, extra anisotropy contributions, etc.
- A particle of ferromagnetic material, below a critical particle size (<15 nm for the common materials), would consist of a single magnetic domain, i.e., a particle that is in a state of uniform magnetization at any field.
- e.g.:
    - Au, Pt, Pd are non-magnetic in bulk, but magnetic in Nano
    - In Pt and Pd, ferromagnetism arises due to structural changes with size effect
    - Iron oxide nanoparticles such as magnetite (Fe3O4) or its oxidized form maghemite ($\gamma$\-Fe2O3) are the most commonly used nanoparticles for biomedical applications.

## 1.4) Electrical Properties

<img src="../../_resources/be40025d36591873d0d90e1ed5613ab3.png" width="300" class="jop-noMdConv">

- When compared to bulk materials, the Conductivity of nanoparticles reduces.
- This is due to decreased size due to which particles are further apart due to which valence band and conduction band move further away.

## 1.5) Thermal Properties

- Melting point of nanomaterial is lower than its bulk material as there are fewer atoms which are further apart which leads to reduced intermolecular force.
- Example:
    - Melting point of bulk CdSe = 1678 K
    - Melting point of 3 nm CdSe = 700 K

## 1.6) Mechanical Properties

- Nanoparticles have good tensile strength, hardness, ductility, elasticity, and fracture resistance compared to their bulk counterparts
- This is because nano size grains have fewer defects due to smaller size.
- They have excellent mechanical properties due to the volume, surface and quantum effects.
- That is why addition of nanoparticles can promote mechanical properties of the matrix.
    - Therefore, they are used as fillers in polymers to enhance mechanical properties.
    - In addition, the amount, ratio, and nanoparticle size have a certain impact on the mechanical properties of nanocomposites
- e.g. Cu-NP is 3x more resistant to stress than Bulk Cu.

# 2) Types of Nanoparticles

## 1) 0D

## 2) 1D

- Here the charge carriers are free to move in only one direction but their movement is confined in other two directions.
- **e.g.** CNTs, Nano rods, Nano wires, Nano fibers. Carbon Nanohorns

## 3) 2D

- 2 Dimensions are beyond nano range and only 1 dimension is in nano range
- Here the charge carriers are free to move in two directions but confined to only one direction.
- **e.g.** Graphene, Nano thin films, Nano Coatings, Multilayered Graphitic Sheets, Carbon Nanoribbons (Unizpped CNTs)

## 4) 3D

tube, or it can also have many other different shapes and sizes.
- Closed fullerenes, especially C60, are called buckyballs (due to resemblence to soccer balls)

## Nanomaterials in Solar Cell
### Classical Solar Cell
- It is a P/N junction in its basic form which converts sunlight to electricity.
- Conversion takes place when electron-hole pairs absorb photons whose $E\geq \text{Energy Gap}$
- The types of materials used as the photovoltaic absorbant are of mostly silicon and its different forms(monocrystalline or multicrystalline):
	- GaAs
	- CdTe
	- CuInSe~2~
- There is free carrier migration from in P/N Junction until the excess electron holes in P and electrons in N attain equilibrium.
- Classical solar cells require thicker materials to perform good optical absorption.
- Have Fixed Band Gap

</center>

### Nano-Based Solar Cells
- Photovoltaic cells built on a substrate with a coating of nanomaterial as light absorbing component.
- Nanoenabled solar cells can lead to
	- Higher optical absorption, lower reflectance and tunable band gaps, and hence solar cell efficiency.
	- Improved trapping, and plasmonic effects therefore, increased effective path length of light in the solar cell
	- Flexible and easy integration with other materials.
#### Quantum dot solar cells
- Uses PbSe, PbS, CdSe quantum dots as the photovoltaic absorbent.
- Have tunable bandgaps across a wide range of energy levels depending upon their size.
	- Therefore, light from a wider spectrum can be absorbed
##### Working of QDSSC:
1) QD's present on photo anode is exposed to sunlight.
2) QD's absorb energy and eject electrons to the semiconductor, forming electron holes.
3) Electrolyte occupys the electron hole and gets reduced.

#### Dye-sensitized Nano solar cell or pigmented solar cell
- A photo-electrode is prepared by coating dye (Ex- Ruthenium-polypyridyl) bound Nano titanium dioxide (TiO2) on the electrode.
- Dyes contain light active area due to extended systems of conjugated double bonds.
- When photons in the sunlight strike the electrode, electrons in the dye are passed to the TiO2 nanoparticle, then enters the electrode and finally reaches the opposite electrode through the wire (reducing electrode) producing current in the external  circuit.
- Pigment cavity, on the other side, is regenerated by a solvent and hence absorbs the next photon in the sunlight.
