# Charge
- Charge is the propery associated with matter due to which it produces and experiences electrical and magnetic effects.
- The excess or deficiency of electrons in a body is the only cause of change of net charge in a body.
- Units of charge:
	- $1\text{ Coulumb}= 3\times10^9\text{ Stat Coulumb}$
	- $10\text{ Coulumb} = 1\text{ Absolute Coulumb}$
	- $96500\text{ Coulumb} = 1\text{ Faraday}$
	- $3600\text{ Coulumb} = 1\text{ Ampere-hr}$
## Specific Properties of Charge
1) Charge is a scalar quantity
2) Charge represents excess or deficiency of electrons
3) Charge is transferrable
4) Charge is always associated with mass
	- Charge cannot exist without mass, however mass can exist without net charge
5) Mass of a body changes with charge
	- Mass of a body increases when given negative charge due to gaining of electrons.
	- Similiarly, mass decreases when given pasitive charge due to loss of electrons.
6) Charge is quantized.
	- The quantization of charge is the property by which all free charges are integral multiples of a basic unit of charge ($1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$)
7. Charge is conserved in an isolated system
	- In an isolated system, total charge doesn't change with time, though individual charges may change.
	- Conservation of charge is also found to satnd true in all types of reactions (Physical, Chemical or Nuclear), No exception to this rule has ever been found.
8. Charge is invariable with speed.
	- Charge is invariable with the frame of reference. i.e. charge of a body does not change, whatever be its speed.
	- This statement arises from the comparison of charge with relativistic mass concept in which mass increases with extreme
	-  It is given by the formula:
$$
E=\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$
Where:
$E = \text{Energy}$
$c = \text{Speed of light}$
$m = \text{mass of object}$
$v = \text{velocity of object}$

- On the contrary, when charge moves with a definite speed or acceleration, different varieties of fields and waves are observed, when observed from different reference frames.
	- $v=0$ produces electric fields
	- $v=\text{constant}$ produces electric field and magnetic field.
	- $v=\text{accelerating}$ produces electric field, maybe electromagnetic waves.
## Methods of Charging
1) Friction
2) Conduction
3) Induction

### 1) Friction
- When we run one body with another body, electrons are transferred.
	- e.g. Clouds get charged due to friction

|Positive Charge (+)|Negative Charge(-)|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|Glass Rod|Silk Cloth|
|Woolen Cloth|Rubber Shoes / Plastic|
|Cat Skin|Ebonite Rod|
|Dry Hair|Plastic (Comb / Ruler)|

### 2) Conduction
- The process of transfer of charge by contact of two conducting bodies.

### 3) Induction
- When a charged body is brought near a neutral / uncharged body, the charged body will attract opposite charges and repel like charges present in the body.
	- As a result, one side of the neutral body becomes negative while the other side becomes positive.
- Hence, induction is a phenomenon of redistribution of charge of a neutral body when any other body is brought near it.

Steps to charge a body induction:
1. Charged Body is brought near uncharged body
2. Uncharged body is grounded
3. Body is unearthed.
4. Charging Body is removed.

# Coulumb's Law
- The electrostatic force of attraction between two point electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of distance betweeen them.

$$
\therefore F \propto q_1q_2
\\
\
\\
\text{And, }F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
\\
\
\\
\therefore F\propto \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
\\
\
\\
\boxed{F =  k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}}
$$
where, $k$ is the electrostatic force / coulumb's constant
In a vacuum, $k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o} = 9\times10^9 \text{ Nm}^2/\text{C}^2$
## Coulumb's Law in vector form:
$$
\vec{F} = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}
\\
\
\\
\boxed{\vec{F} = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^3}\vec{r}}
$$

### Principle of Superposition
$$
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F_{12}}+\vec{F_{13}}+\dots+\vec{F_{1n}}
\\
\
\\
\therefore\vec{F} = kq_1\bigg(\frac{q_2}{r_{12}^2}\hat{r_{12}}+ \frac{q_3}{r_{13}^2}\hat{r_{13}}+ \dots+\frac{q_n}{r_{1n}^2}\hat{r_{1n}}\bigg)
$$
- These forces are to be added vectorially.
# Electric Field
- The zone or area in which a set of charges emphasize their influence over other external charges is called the electric field of those set of charges.
- To quantify the influence of a set of charges in a zone, a unit positive charge is kept at the point where the influence due to a set of charges is to be calculated. The force on this unit of charge due to the set of charges came to be known as electric field

Due to a set of charges:
$$
\vec{E} = k\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}
\\
\
\\
\therefore \text{For 1 C (test charge): }\qquad \vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}
$$
- Unit: $\text{N/C}$
### Principle of Superposition
$$
\vec{E}_{\text{net}} = \frac{k\ q_1\ \hat{r_1}}{r_1^2} + \frac{k\ q_2\ \hat{r_2}}{r_2^2}+\dots+\frac{k\ q_n\ \hat{r_n}}{r_n^2}
$$

## Continous Charge Distribution

Linear Charge Density $\lambda = \frac{q}{l}=\frac{dq}{dl}$
Surface (Planar) Charge Density $\sigma = \frac{q}{A}=\frac{dq}{dA}$
Volume Charge Density $\rho = \frac{q}{V}=\frac{dq}{dV}$

### Electric Field due to Linear Bodies:
$$
dq=\lambda dl
\\
\
\\
\int d\vec{E}=\frac{k\lambda dl}{r^2}\hat{r}
$$

### Electric Field due to Planar Bodies:
$$
dq=\sigma dA
\\
\
\\
\int d\vec{E}=\frac{k\sigma dA}{r^2}\hat{r}
$$

### Electric Field due to 3-D Bodies:
$$
dq=\rho dV
\\
\
\\
\int d\vec{E}=\frac{k\rho dV}{r^2}\hat{r}
$$
