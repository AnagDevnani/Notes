# Introduction
- **Current:** Charge flowing through a conductor per unit time through a cross-section.
	- Current is scalar, and is considred a fundamental quantity
	- Unit: $\text{C/s}$ or $\text{A (Ampere)}$ 
- $+ve$ charge always flows from higher potential to lower potential to gain stability.
- $-ve$ charge flows from lower to higher potential due to the definition of potential which is defined for unit $+ve$ charge. So, the point where unit $+ve$ charge is unstable, there $-ve$ charge will be stable and vice-versa.
- Though all caharges move naturally in their respective directions to attain stability.

## Thermal Speed
- Conductor contain a large no. of free electrons which are continously in motion.
- Due to this random motion, the electrons collide with $+ve$ metal ions at high frequency and change direction at each collision.

# Rating of an Appliance
- It is of the form of (${V, P}$) where $V$ is the maximum voltage the appliance can withstand at which it will produce power $P$.
- Above the rated voltage or power, the appliance will get fused.
- Another Information which can be obtained from this rating is the rating of the appliance:
$$
P=\frac{V^2}{R}
$$

# Measuring Devices
## Galvanometer
### Shunt
- The small resistance connected in parallel to a galvanometer coil in order to control the current flowing through it is called shunt of an ammeter.
- The extremely large resistance connected in series to a galvanometer in order to control the current flowing through the galvanometer is known as shunt of a voltmeter.

## Conversion of galvanometer into an ammeter
- A galvanometer can be converted into an ammeter by connecting a low resistance shunt in parallel to its coil.
- The concept arises from the thought that an ideal ammeter should have zero resistance. This is because an ideal ammeter which is connected in series should measure the current without disturbing the whole circuit. This can only be done when its resistance is zero.
- A galvanometer already has a resistance of the order of 10^2^ to 10^3^ $\Omega$. So to convertthe galvanometer to an approx. zero resistance ammeter, we coonnect an extremely low resistance shunt in parallel to the galvanometer keeping in mind that in parallel, the **effective resistance is lesser than the least**.
- To convert a galvanometer into an ammeter we connect a low resistance shunt such thaat the maximum current to be measured passes through the shunt and only a small current $I_g$ passes through thr galvanometer to show deflection, which is at its maximum value $I_{g \text{ max}}$ for the current $I$ for which the ammeter is being designed. 

## Conversion of galvanometer to Voltmeter
- A galvanometer can be converterd into a voltmeter by connecting a high resistance in series with its coil.
- This arises from the thought that the resistance of an ideal voltmeter should tebd to infinity becasue a voltmeter us always connected in parallel and an ideal voltmeter should measure potential difference but should not disturb the circuit by its connection.
$$
\frac{1}{R_\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{R_\text{o}} + \frac{1}{R_\text{v}}
\\
\
\\
\text{If, } R_\text{v}\longrightarrow \infty
\\
\
\\
R_\text{eff} = R_\text{o}
$$

## Potentiometer
- A potentiometer is a device which is used to measure a variety of unkowns. **e.g.** EMF of a battery, internal resistance of a battery, unknown resistance, works as a voltmeter and an ammeter, etc.
- A potentiometer consists of a primary circuit as well as a secondary circuit. The primary circuit consists of a battery, a rheostat and a potentiometer wire.
- The external circuit in which an unknown is to be measured is called the secondary circuit.
- The potentiometer works on the principle of "no-deflection" on the galvanometer, which gives the advantage of not using galvanometer resistance and still getting a reading which maintains the ideality of the instrument.
- When the pointer comes to a point where the galvanometer shows no deflection, we say that no current flows from the secondary circuit to the primary circuit and vice-versa. and both circuits become independant of each other with one similiarity betweem them. i.e. the potential difference between the points connected of the primary circuit and the secondary circuit is the same.
### Applications of the potentiometer
#### 1) Internal resistance of a given primary cell
#### 2) Comparison of resistances
