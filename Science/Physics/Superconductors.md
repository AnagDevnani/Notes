Kammerlingh Onnes in 1911, observed that the electrical resistivity of pure mercury drops to 0 at about 4.2K.

This stage is called superconducting state, and the material is called superconductor. The temperature at which superconductivity is attained is crititcal temperature (T~c~)

## Temperature dependence if resistivity in a metal
All metals are good conductors. The conductivity raises with temperature.
The resistance to the flow of current is due to scattering of conduction electrons by lattice vibration.
When the temperature increases, the amplitude of lattice vibrations also increases, therby increasing the resistance. The dependence of resistance of a metal w/ temperature is shown in the diagram.
The resistance decreases with temperature and reaches a minimum value at ~ 0K. The residual resistance at 0K is due to inpurities in the metal.

Barden-Cooper-Schrieffer in  1957, explained the phenomenon of superconductivity based on the formation of cooper pairs.

When a current flows in a superconductor, electrons come near the positive ion core of the lattice due to attractive force. The ion core also gets displaced from its position, which is called lattice distortion.

The lattice vibration is quantized (phonons).

Now an electron which comes near that place will interact with the distorted lattice.

This tends to reduce the energy of the electron. It is equivalent to interaction between two electrons through the lattice.

This leads to the formation of cooper pairs.

Cooper pairs are bound pairs of electrons formed by the interaction between the electrons with opposite spin & momenta in a phonon field.

According to quantum mechanics, a cooper pair is treated as a single entity,

When electrons flow in the form of cooper pairs in materials, the do not encounter any scattering and the resistance factor vanishes(conductivity $=\infty$, resistance $\approx0$).Which is called as superconductivity.

In superconducting state, electron - phonon interaction is stronger than the coulumb source of attraction of electrons.

Cooper pairs are not scattered by the lattice points. They travel freely without slowdown as their energy is not transferred. due to this, they do not posses electrical resistivity.

## Critical Current
The current in a superconductive material, above which the material is normal and below which the materia is super conducting, at a specified temperatire and in the absence of external magnetic fields.
$$
\text I_\text C = 2\pi r\text H_\text C
$$

## High Temperature Superconductors
CUPRATE - Perovskite by Bednorz-Muller 1986
The first high temperature superconductor LaBaCuO at 30K
$\ce{La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO4}$ at 40K
posses a particular tupe of structure called perovskite crystal structure. As the number Cu layers increases, the T~C~ value increases. The current in the high T~C~ materials is direction dependant. It is strong in parallel to CuO planes and weak in perpendicular to CuO planes.

High T~C~ materials come under type-2 and they are brittle and done't carry enough current,

The formation of electron pairs is not due to interaction of electron and lattice as in the BCS Theory.

High temperature superconductors are useful in high field applications, It can carry high currents of 10^5^ - 10^6^ A in moderate magnetic fields, They are used in military applications, Josephson junction in S.Q.U.I.D.s, Undersea communication in submarines.
